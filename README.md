# Syria-Tel-Customer-Churn-Analysis-Phase-3-Project.
## Business Understanding.
Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies like Syria Tel. When too many customers leave, it can mean big financial losses, higher marketing and acquisition costs, and a shrinking market share. To stay competitive, Syria Tel needs to understand why customers leave and what patterns lead to churn. By identifying these factors, they can take action to keep their customers happy and reduce revenue loss.
## Problem Statement
This project is focused on developing predictive models to identify customers who are likely to stop using Syria Tel's services in the near future. By recognizing these at-risk customers early, Syria Tel can take proactive steps to address their concerns, improve their experience, and encourage them to stay. The goal is to reduce customer churn and strengthen customer loyalty, ultimately helping the company maintain a stable and satisfied customer base.
## Modeling
I used Logistic regression, Decision trees, Random Forest models to come up with findings. Logistic regression was my baseline model.

## Evaluation
I used the AUC score to evaluate the models
Model Performance Summary (AUC Scores): Random Forest: AUC = 0.91 (Best performance).
Decision Tree: AUC = 0.90 (Strong, slightly behind Random Forest).
Logistic Regression: AUC = 0.83 (Good, but weakest among the three).
